About:
    This is code from the book "Node.js the Right Way" by Jim Wilson that I am using to learn the basics of Node.js.

network.js:
    To test this javascript file run it with node and connect to the server via telnet by typing "telnet localhost 5432"

networkUnixSockets.js:
    This is similar to network.js but it uses unix sockets. To use this use the command "nc -U /tmp/watcher.sock"
